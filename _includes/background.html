      Currently, I'm studying for a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering from
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.stcet.org/" target="_blank">St. Thomas' College of Engineering and Technology</a>.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably exercising, trying to play random songs on my ukulele,
      or staring at stray cats from the window.
